# Markowitz Portfolio Theory Implementation

This project is mainly copied from: https://medium.com/python-data/effient-frontier-in-python-34b0c3043314

This program was created for my own educational purposes to truly understand Markowitz Portfolio Theory (taught to me by Toomas Laartis of NYU).

I am also using this program to dip my hands in python data science tools such as numpy, pandas, quandl, and more.

No part of this program is / will be used for commercial or enterprise purposes.

## Part 1: Efficient Frontier of 50,000 imaginary portfolios using 5 user-specified stock tickers
